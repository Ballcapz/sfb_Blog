			<h2>Part 5 - Carving the Shape</h2>

			<p class="fPara">
				This was one of the longest and most strenuous parts of the creation of this board. It has taken me
				around a
				week in order to get to a point where I am somewhat happy with the shape of the board. It's not perfect,
				but
				I know it never will be and it's good enough for who it's for.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Part 5 - I started out making some progress with the bottom rocker, or the curve of the bottom of the
				board.
				I am only using my <a href="https://amzn.to/2J6utH4" target="_blank">Surform</a> along with starting out
				from a square blank. With both factors in play, it took me quite a while to come up with a shape
				resembling
				a board. <br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/6ctaov7ht/IMG_20180713_174200.jpg"
					alt="Bottom rocker shape surfboard"><br><br> After that, I started in on the top, and this ended up
				taking twice as long as the bottom because the center of the stringer, the thickest part, was even with
				the
				bottom of the board. This gave me twice as much foam on top compared to the bottom. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/dsskaq0cx/IMG_20180716_210841.jpg"
					alt="Starting shape top surfboard"><br><br> <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/ndc6xlhz5/IMG_20180718_204717.jpg"
					alt="Rough shape top surfboard"><br><br>
				Here is also a side profile of the board where you can see the rocker shape a little bit better. As
				shown, I
				used a fairly flat rocker, reason being it fit better in a square 4 inch piece of foam and it is a bit
				of a
				crossover with a stand-up paddle board. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/sbzpc3qwx/IMG_20180718_205338.jpg" alt="Side profile surfboard"><br><br>
				After several days of work, I finally reached the point that all the pros were saying is the hardest
				part of
				shaping, the rails. Boy were they right! The work on the rails did not take me as much time as the other
				parts, but they were definitley the most difficult by far. I started out with marking some 'Rail Bands'
				with
				a pencil with some guides that I found online. Then I started sanding down until I had something
				resembling
				a rail of a surfboard. Then it was just a few short hours of finetuning and sanding until I got to a
				point
				where I was happy with the shape. It is definitely not perfect by any means, but through all the
				research
				that I have done on the topic one of the number one pieces of advice that professionals have given is to
				not
				keep working and working until all you have left is a pile of sanded foam. I know that I will keep
				improving
				in the future, but for right now i'll have a board that floats. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/ycxe96syp/IMG_20180719_202417.jpg" alt="Shaped rails surfboard"><br><br>
				After that, I used some very fine sandpaper to smooth out a bunch of little imperfections, and now I am
				finally ready to get to the glassing of my board!

			<h2>Part 4 - Outline & Beginning Shape</h2>

			<p class="fPara">
				I was finally able to get started on cutting out the shape of my board and starting to shape it after
				waiting for the glue to dry for 24 hours. Having that time did allow me to make some more plans for what
				I
				was doing with the board though.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Part 4 - Today my surfboard is finally starting to look a little bit more like a surfboard! The first
				thing
				that I did tonight was to cut out the template that I used for the shape of the board. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/byp6hc041/IMG_20180712_163444.jpg"><br><br> I was able to download the
				free
				template from <a href="https://www.blendingcurves.com/">Blending Curves</a>, which is an awesome website
				with tons of resources for shaping boards. Next, I laid out the template on my square blank and traced
				it
				out with a sharpie. <br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/n9ru694kh/IMG_20180712_165027.jpg"><br><br>
				After
				taking measurements and making sure both sides were equal distances from the stringer and centered on
				the
				stringr, I began to cut it. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/hmvh87p0x/IMG_20180712_170955.jpg"><br><br>
				<img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/6m0c3rhip/IMG_20180712_190942.jpg"><br><br> After I had it rough cut, I
				used my <a href="https://amzn.to/2J6utH4" target="_blank">Surform</a> and <a
					href="https://amzn.to/2u7uOVm" target="_blank">Sandpaper</a> to smooth out and finsh shaping the
				edges of the board so both sides were
				symemetrical and smooth. <br> <img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/dcgtd6hj5/IMG_20180712_203031.jpg"><br><br>
				Finally, I was able to get started on planing down the foam to create the shape of my board. For my
				first
				board, I am just using hand tools to do the shaping, so I started in with my <a
					href="https://amzn.to/2J6utH4" target="_blank">Surform</a> and made some good progress in a short
				amount
				of time. <br> <img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/zbn80dixt/IMG_20180712_203053.jpg"><br><br> I am excited
				to
				see how far I can get on the shaping by the end of this weekend, hopefully within a week or two I will
				have
				a waterproof and floating board!

			<h2>Part 2 & 3 - Glue</h2>

			<p class="fPara">
				The last few days have been busier than usual for me, so I am just now getting to an update on my board.
				This evening I reached the point of gluing a stringiner in the middle of the board. Hopefully tomorrow I
				can
				begin to shape it!
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Part 2 - The first thing that I did yesterday was to set up my shaping bay in my barn. It took quite a
				bit
				of time, as I built two shaping stands, as well as sectioning off an area with clear poly, but I am
				pretty
				happy with the current set up that I have. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/6h8xpeuox/IMG_20180709_203922.jpg" alt="Shaping Bay"><br><br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/5rq5d1701/IMG_20180709_193231.jpg"
					alt="shaping, surfboard shaping stand, shaping stand"><br><br> After that I measured to the center
				of
				the board, and clamped on a guide board to keep my saw straight while I was cutting the board. To cut
				the
				board, I used a <a href="https://amzn.to/2ustSdy" target="_blank">Dewalt Circular Saw</a> with the blade
				on
				backwards to cut the foam. With the blade on backwards, it doesn't chew up the foam as bad giving a much
				smoother cut. After that, I printed out a template for a stringer online, and cut out my stringer out of
				3/16" plywood. <br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/5eyr6x9bl/IMG_20180710_190403.jpg"
					alt="stringer"><br><br> Finally, I placed the stringer onto one half where I wanted it and glued it
				down
				with some <a href="https://amzn.to/2zy9zkO">Gorilla Glue</a>. I had to switch glues because the gorilla
				glue
				foams up a little bit and helps to make a nice, tight seal between the two pieces that are being glued.
				<br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/d7peyx2g1/IMG_20180711_152727.jpg"
					alt="stringer, glued stringer, glue"><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Part 3 - Today's work was pretty quick and light compared to the last few days of working on the board.
				Today I glued the other half of the board onto the half with the stringer already on it, and set it up
				to
				dry overnight. First I sanded down some excess glue that was on the first half, then I glued and placed
				the
				other half on top of the first one. I put a 2x4 on the top edge, and used <a
					href="https://amzn.to/2ufEzkl" target="_blank">ratchet straps</a> to hold and clamp the two halves
				together. <br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/n50frzphd/IMG_20180711_155052.jpg"
					alt="surfboard, glued, glued stringer"><br><br> If everything turns out as planned, I will be
				starting
				on the shaping of the board tomorrow!

			<h2>Part 1 - XPS Foam</h2>

			<p class="fPara">
				Today was the first day of my new summer project and possible hobby. I started the process of building
				and
				shaping surf boards and Stand-up paddle boards.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				I started research for this board about a week ago when I saw the cost of some Stand-up paddle boards
				online. Then I got a look at the setup of one of my extended relatives and decided that this was a hobby
				that I wanted to pick up. So off to Youtube I went. I surfed the web to find many different ideas and
				techniques I could use for my first board. What I came up with is that I might as well start from
				scratch,
				or as close to it as possible. I decided to start with making the foam blank.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				I bought a 2 inch thick piece of Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) foam from Home Depot this afternoon and got
				started on setting up my area and the first steps of making the blank as soon as I returned home. First
				I
				measured and marked and squared up the center of the sheet of XPS. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/en1k19cjl/Full_XPS.jpg"><br><br> Then I sawed it in half with a hand
				saw.
				<br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/7jtollwtd/Cut_XPS.jpg"><br><br> After that I squared the two pieces
				up
				and smoothed out the rough edges with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2J6utH4" target="_blank">Surform</a>
				and
				sandpaper. Next, I sanded the two faces of the foam that were going to be glued together, and covered
				the
				face of one of the boards with <a href="https://amzn.to/2m1dnkQ" target="_blank">Liquid Nails</a>
				construction adhesive. <br><img src="https://s22.postimg.cc/7wl2ru4td/Sanded_XPS.jpg"><br><br> <img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/bg70hnf8x/Glued_XPS.jpg"><br><br> <img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/p9vd6pn9t/Liquid_Nails.jpg"><br><br> I used a ratchet strap to hold
				together
				the center of the board, then I placed it on the ground and placed some weights on top of it to keep
				good
				pressure on the board while the glue dries. <br><img
					src="https://s22.postimg.cc/b3fmbghjl/Weighted_XPS.jpg"><br><br> Tomorrow the strap and weights will
				be
				removed and we'll see how it turns out!

			<h2>My Tools and Supplies</h2>

			<p class="fPara">
				I figured I'd throw in another post tonight. Here are some of the tools and supplies that I am using as
				of
				today.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				This first tool that I use to shape and to smooth out the board is a standard Surform.
				The model that I use is a Stanley 21-296 Surform Plane<br>
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2J6utH4" target="_blank"><img
						src="https://s22.postimg.cc/c5pstzd7l/surform.jpg"></a><br>
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2J6utH4" target="_blank">Stanley 21-296 Surform Plane</a>
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				The adhesive that I have been using to stick everything together is Liquid Nails Construction Adhesive.
				I get mine in the 10oz. varity, and use a caulking gun to apply it nice and spread out.
				This stuff has worked wonders so far and is fairly inexpensive for what you get.
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2m1dnkQ" target="_blank"><img
						src="https://s22.postimg.cc/p9vd6pn9t/Liquid_Nails.jpg"></a><br>
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2m1dnkQ" target="_blank">Liquid Nails</a>
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Next we have the foam that I use for the main body of the board.
				This is just regular construction polystyrene foam.
				The brand I got is Owens Corning Fomular 250 XPS foam.
				The reason for the 250 over the 150 is the 10 psi higher density of the 250.
				<br><img
					src="https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/0e87b0aa-b5e3-4281-914c-127fdbd86be3/svn/owens-corning-rigid-insulation-52dd-64_1000.jpg"><br>
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Another one of the main tools that I use is a standard Stanley 15in Fat Max Hand Saw.
				It cuts like a dream and I use it to cut the foam in half as well as cut the rough shape of the board.
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2NCSlpl" target="_blank"><img
						src="https://s22.postimg.cc/wpumsg5td/handsaw.jpg"></a><br>
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2NCSlpl" target="_blank">Stanley Fat Max Hand Saw</a>
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Last but not least, we can not forget our sandpaper. At the beginning, I have been using a 60 or 40 grit
				to rough up the foam a little bit and get some of the edges close to equal to eachother. Some of the
				real
				smoothing will come later on in the process. My favorite sandpaper so far has been 3M Pro Grade.<br>
				<a href="https://amzn.to/2u7uOVm" target="_blank"><img
						src="https://s22.postimg.cc/vnkg9x2fl/sandpaper.jpg"></a><br>
